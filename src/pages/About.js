            <p>
                I’m Arun Kumar Anguraja, a Principal Software Engineer based in Bangalore. I was born in a small town near Salem, Tamil Nadu, and spent my early life in Pondicherry, where I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>Starting my career as an intern in Bangalore, I’ve spent the last ten years focusing on user interface development, particularly with SAP. Recently, I’ve shifted my focus to Microsoft technologies, including MAUI and Azure Cloud, and I hold certifications in Machine Learning and AI.
            </p>
            <p>I’m passionate about problem-solving and technology, especially in the agricultural sector, as I own a farm back home. My wife, who is also in IT, collaborates with me on farm tech projects.
            </p>
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, cooking, and reading, starting with Ikigai. I’m interested in politics and aspire to learn more about it, with hopes of joining a political party in the future.
            </p>
            <p>Inspired by my boss, Nakul, and Elon Musk, I aim to become a solution architect and eventually start my own technology company. My goal is to leverage technology to help society and promote a world where kindness prevails.
